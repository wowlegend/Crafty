### February 23, 2026 (Architecture Refactor — Phase 1 & 2)

- **PHASE 1: ZUSTAND STATE MIGRATION**:
  - Removed the monolithic `useGameState` from `App.js` which caused massive prop drilling.
  - Extracted game state into a global `useGameStore.js` using Zustand.
  - Rewired all UI components to consume `useGameStore` directly instead of prop drilling.

- **PHASE 2: RAPIER PHYSICS UPGRADE**:
  - Replaced custom AABB jump/gravity math with `@react-three/rapier` WebAssembly physics engine.
  - Wrapped 3D Canvas in `<Physics>` provider.
  - Converted terrain blocks to `<InstancedRigidBodies>` for physical collisions.
  - Upgraded Player to dynamic `<RigidBody>` with `<CapsuleCollider>`.

### February 23-24, 2026 — Physics Debugging & Terrain Collision Fixes

- **TERRAIN COLLISION BUG**:
  - Diagnosed that `InstancedRigidBodies` required an `instances` array prop (not flat `Float32Array` buffers).
  - Player was falling infinitely through the world due to zero-scale collision matrices.
  - Void Catch reset at `y < -10` was locking X/Z coordinates to `(0, 0)`.

- **CAMERA PITCH BUG**:
  - R3F Canvas auto-pointed camera at `(0,0,0)`, causing a -90° downward pitch from spawn at `(0, 30, 0)`.
  - `PointerLockControls` cached this angle, permanently locking the view to the ground.
  - Fixed by forcing `camera.lookAt(0, 30, -100)` in `onCreated` hook.

- **INVISIBLE FIREBALLS**:
  - Camera pointed straight down → fireballs spawned 2 units below the player, through the floor.
  - Fixed by correcting camera orientation (fireballs now spawn forward).

- **PEER DEPENDENCY CRASH**:
  - `@react-three/rapier` v2.2.0 required `@react-three/fiber` v9 (we had v8).
  - React silently dropped `<RigidBody>` refs due to `forwardRef` incompatibility.
  - Temporarily downgraded to Rapier v1.5.0 before performing the full stack upgrade.

### February 24, 2026 — Full Tech Stack Upgrade (CRA → Vite)

- **BUILD SYSTEM MIGRATION**:
  - Migrated from Create React App (deprecated) to **Vite 6.4** build system.
  - Build time reduced from ~30s to ~3.7s.
  - Created `vite.config.js` with React plugin and JSX-in-.js support.
  - Moved `index.html` from `public/` to project root (Vite convention).
  - Renamed `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js` to `.cjs` (ESM compat).

- **DEPENDENCY CHAIN UPGRADE**:
  - React 18.2 → **19.0**, React DOM 18.2 → **19.0**
  - @react-three/fiber 8.18 → **9.5.0**

  - @react-three/rapier 1.5 → **2.2.0**
  - three 0.158 → **0.172.0**
  - framer-motion 10.0 → **12.34.3**
  - zustand 4.x → **5.0.11**

- **CODE MIGRATION**:
  - Renamed 16 source files from `.js` → `.jsx` (Vite requires explicit JSX extensions).
  - Updated Zustand import: `import create` → `import { create }` (v5 named export).
  - Converted `process.env.REACT_APP_*` → `import.meta.env.VITE_*` (Vite env vars).
  - Removed CRA dependencies: `react-scripts`, `cra-template`, `schema-utils`, `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object`.
  - Updated `package.json` scripts: `start` → `vite`, `build` → `vite build`.
  - Added `"type": "module"` to package.json for native ESM support.

### February 25, 2026 — Full Codebase Audit & Physics Architecture Overhaul

- **PHYSICS ARCHITECTURE OVERHAUL**:
  - Removed `InstancedRigidBodies` from terrain (was creating ~80,000 individual cuboid colliders)
  - Replaced with `TrimeshCollider` — one per chunk (~50 total), using exact world-space vertices
  - 1,600× reduction in Rapier physics body count
  - `ChunkMesh` converted to visual-only `instancedMesh` rendering

- **PLAYER MOVEMENT FIXES**:
  - Fixed WASD direction by replacing fragile Euler extraction with `camera.getWorldDirection()`
  - Fixed A/D strafing flip (`moveA - moveD` → `moveD - moveA`)
  - Removed `React.StrictMode` (caused double-mount of physics bodies in React 19)
  - Keyboard input: `useState` → `useRef` (eliminated stale closures + 60+ re-renders/sec)

- **HAND RENDERING**:
  - Implemented smoothed camera matrix (lerp 0.08) for hand positioning
  - Decoupled hand rendering from physics micro-bounce entirely
  - Removed all idle hand bob animations

- **UX FIXES**:
  - Death screen: auto-exits pointer lock so Respawn button is clickable
  - Quest claim: Press Q to auto-claim all completed quests (pointer lock compatible)
  - Quest tracker: "Claim!" button → animated "Press Q" badge
  - Removed full-screen crosshair overlay that blocked all UI clicks
  - Replaced stale CRA webpack-dev-server overlay with Vite-compatible ResizeObserver handler

- **TERRAIN STABILITY**:
  - `RENDER_DISTANCE` = 4 with chunk keep radius of `RENDER_DISTANCE + 3`

  - `update-prd.md`: Added Tech Stack Reference section


### April 2, 2026 (Cleanup Phase) — Comprehensive Project Audit & Cleanup

- **STALE ARTIFACT REMOVAL**:
  - Deleted obsolete `frontend/build/` directory (leftover from previous builds).
  - Removed 3 `.DS_Store` files (`Crafty/`, `frontend/`, `.git/`).
  - Deleted empty `frontend/src/entities/` directory.
  - Total disk cleanup: ~27MB.

- **DEPENDENCY & SOURCE AUDIT**:
  - Verified 17/17 source files are actively imported and functional.
  - Confirmed all 10 production dependencies (`react`, `three`, `zustand`, etc.) are in use.
  - Verified no `console.log` statements remain in source code (only `console.warn`/`console.error` for legitimate system feedback).

- **PERFORMANCE & QUALITY CHECK**:
  - Confirmed React performance patterns: 18 `memo`, 26 `useCallback`, 7 `useMemo` implementations across the codebase.
  - Verified Vite 6.4 build success (2.84s build time).
  - Identified and documented heavy `window.*` global usage (12 files) for future consolidation into Zustand.
  - Audited CSS: Identified 4 unused classes/rules in `App.css`.

- **INFRASTRUCTURE**:
  - Verified `.gitignore` and dotfiles are minimal and correct for the Vite/React stack.

### April 3, 2026 (Cleanup Phase) — Routine Codebase Maintenance

- **STALE ARTIFACT REMOVAL**:
  - Deleted newly generated `frontend/build/` directory.
  - Removed 2 `.DS_Store` files (`Crafty/`, `frontend/`).

- **DEPENDENCY & SOURCE AUDIT**:
  - Verified 17/17 source files are actively imported.
  - Confirmed all production dependencies are in use.
  - Verified no `console.log` debug statements exist.

- **PERFORMANCE & QUALITY CHECK**:
  - Verified Vite 6.4 build compiles successfully (production ready).

### April 3, 2026 (Phase 3) — Architectural Overhaul & State Consolidation

- **CONSOLIDATED STATE**:
  - Migrated core combat and gameplay globals (`damagePlayer`, `healPlayer`, `useMana`, `isAlive`, `getPlayerHealth`, `getPlayerMana`, `consumeHunger`, `feedPlayer`, `respawn`) from `window.*` into `useGameStore` (Zustand).
  - Cleaned up inefficient `setInterval` polling in `StableMagicHands` by reacting directly to `activeSpell` from the Zustand store.
  - Eliminated legacy `window.selectedSpell` variable completely.

- **WORLD STATE SYNCHRONIZATION**:
  - Fixed Save/Load bug: Synchronized `blocksRef` in `Terrain.jsx` directly with the Zustand store (`gameState.worldBlocks`).
  - Added `PlayerModifiedBlocks` component to correctly render saved blocks on load.

- **SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS**:
  - Consolidated duplicate `BLOCK_TYPES` configurations into a single, immutable source of truth (`world/Blocks.js`), updating all imports across the codebase.

### April 3, 2026 (Phase 4) — Component Decomposition

- **ARCHITECTURAL REFACTORING**:
  - Decomposed the massive `App.jsx` (~960 lines) into smaller, specialized modules.
  - Extracted 2D UI overlays (Minimap, HealthBar, QuestTracker, Notifications) into `frontend/src/HUD.jsx`.
  - Encapsulated keyboard events and pointer lock logic into a `useInputManager` hook inside `frontend/src/InputManager.jsx`.
  - Extracted the 3D Canvas, Physics, Player, and World rendering logic into `frontend/src/GameScene.jsx`.
  - Extracted the interactive Main Menu and UI panels (Inventory, Crafting, Auth) into `frontend/src/MenuSystem.jsx`.
  - Simplified `App.jsx` to function cleanly as a top-level orchestrator for providers and root components.

### April 3, 2026 (Phase 5) — Global Cleanup & Physics Raycasting

- **GLOBAL NAMESPACE POLLUTION CLEANUP**:
  - Successfully migrated the remaining `window.*` globals (like `damagePlayer`, `healPlayer`, `useMana`, `consumeHunger`, `respawn`, etc.) into native `useGameStore.getState()` calls across all components (`AdvancedGameFeatures`, `NPCSystem`, `EnhancedMagicSystem`).
  - Removed risky and brittle cross-system dependencies by enforcing a single Zustand state source.
  
- **PRECISE PHYSICS RAYCASTING**:
  - Upgraded block interaction (building/destroying) in `Terrain.jsx` from a naive scalar distance projection to accurate `@react-three/rapier` physics raycasting (`world.castRay`).
  - Player targeting is now driven by physical mesh intersections and normal calculation for flawless block placement against terrain shapes.

### April 3, 2026 (Final Cleanup Phase) — Comprehensive Codebase Audit

- **REDUNDANT COMMENT REMOVAL**:
  - Cleaned up verbose structural dividers (`// ===`, `// ---`) across 6 core source files (`Components.jsx`, `AdvancedGameFeatures.jsx`, `EnhancedMagicSystem.jsx`, `Terrain.jsx`, `GameSystems.jsx`, `SimplifiedNPCSystem.jsx`).
- **DEAD FILE & ARTIFACT CLEANUP**:
  - Ran `unimported` check to verify 0 dead source files in the React frontend.
  - Removed remaining empty directories and stale `.DS_Store` files across the project workspace.
- **FINAL VERIFICATION**:
  - Re-verified Vite 6.4 build passes with 0 errors after the final audit sweeps.

### April 4, 2026 (DD Response) — Security Hardening & Complete Global Elimination

- **SECURITY HARDENING (JWTs)**:
  - Removed all usage of `localStorage` for authentication tokens in `AuthContext.jsx` and `useGameStore.jsx` to neutralize XSS vulnerabilities.
  - Reconfigured `axios` globally with `withCredentials: true` to rely on secure, HttpOnly cookies.
  - Refactored `saveGame` and `loadGame` to use `axios` instead of `fetch`, completely eliminating local token access.
- **COMPLETE STATE CONSOLIDATION**:
  - Eliminated all 45+ remaining `window.*` globals (e.g., `window.getGeneratedChunks`, `window.playHitSound`, `window.grantXP`, `window.onMobKill`, `window._mobEntities`).
  - Added transient functions to `useGameStore` to safely dispatch cross-system events.
  - Safely migrated all components (`SimplifiedNPCSystem`, `EnhancedMagicSystem`, `AdvancedGameFeatures`, etc.) to use `useGameStore.getState()` for purely non-reactive reads within the `useFrame` game loops, resolving brittle side-effects and ensuring a single source of truth.

### April 4, 2026 (Phase 6) — ECS Pivot (Entity Component System)

- **AI PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECK REMOVED**:
  - Fully refactored `SimplifiedNPCSystem.jsx` to strip entity AI, movement, and combat logic out of React's `useState` and component render cycle.
  - Integrated `miniplex` and `@miniplex/react` to manage game logic in a pure data-oriented approach.
  - Implemented `ECSSystemsLogic` to run purely in a single `useFrame` loop, processing pathfinding, physics knockbacks, and damage application entirely via non-reactive entity objects.
- **DIRECT MESH MUTATION**:
  - The `MobModel` components now track their own `entity` references and sync their own Three.js `ref.current.position` locally in a `useFrame`, eliminating cascading `setState` calls up to the `NPCSystem` root for massive FPS gains.
  - React now *only* handles the high-level declarative mounting/unmounting of meshes, completely decoupled from the tight 60Hz physics/movement data stream.

### April 6, 2026 (Phase 7) — Terrain V2 Engine (AAA Voxel Overhaul)

- **WEB WORKER OFFLOADING**:
  - Rebuilt the terrain generation pipeline to run completely asynchronously inside a dedicated Web Worker (`terrain.worker.js`).
  - The main thread (React) now never stalls or drops frames during exploration, passing chunk generation tasks via zero-copy `postMessage` buffers.
- **3D SIMPLEX NOISE & MEMORY OPTIMIZATION**:
  - Replaced the naive 2D scalar heightmap with `simplex-noise` to generate complex 3D noise (fractional brownian motion).
  - Scaled world height from flat hills to a massive 256-block AAA limit (`16x256x16` chunks).
  - Migrated the massive `blocksRef` Map to highly efficient, flat `Uint8Array(65536)` buffers managed by the worker.
- **FACE CULLING & BUFFER GEOMETRY**:
  - Replaced `InstancedMesh` with dynamically generated `BufferGeometry`.
  - Implemented an adjacent-face culling (greedy mesher approximation) algorithm in the worker. Blocks completely buried underground no longer generate geometry, reducing GPU vertex load by up to 90%.
  - Physics meshes are perfectly mapped back into Rapier's `TrimeshCollider` for seamless raycasting and player collision.

### April 6, 2026 (Wave 3 Patch) — The Polish Patch

- **POINTER LOCK CONTEXT RECOVERED**:
  - Removed asynchronous `setTimeout(..., 100)` wrappers around `requestPointerLock` across `InputManager.jsx`, `App.jsx`, and `MenuSystem.jsx` to ensure modern browsers don't block camera locking.
- **AI LOGIC FIXES**:
  - Replaced the flawed `distToPlayer2D` check with proper `distToPlayer3D` logic in the ECS so zombies can't infinitely aggro players towering directly above them.
- **ZUSTAND CLOSURE & RENDER FIXES**:
  - Swapped generic `const gameState = useGameStore()` initializers in root components (`App.jsx`, `GameSystems.jsx`) with highly specific `useShallow` selectors, completely eliminating catastrophic full-tree re-renders on minor state ticks.
  - Rewrote Zustand functional setters (e.g., `setMobEntities`) to safely use their own closures rather than injecting stale state from `get()`.

### April 6, 2026 (Phase 8) — The "Juice" & Game Feel (Visual Polish)

- **TARGET BLOCK OUTLINING**:
  - Implemented continuous physics raycasting within `Terrain.jsx` using `useFrame`.
  - Added a `TargetOutline` component that renders a subtle, transparent 3D wireframe box.
  - The outline dynamically snaps to the exact voxel grid block currently targeted by the player's crosshair via `@react-three/rapier` physics.
